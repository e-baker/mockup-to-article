# Mockup-to-Article

This is a project that I did as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree

There are two parts to it. 

1. First, there's a PDF that was provided. The index.html file is the HTML rendering of that file.

2. Second, the reflections.txt file has some questions with my answers.
